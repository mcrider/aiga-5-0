Proceeds from ConTempo support museum programming; such as art classes; exhibitions; and educational outreach. ConTempo's theme in 2013 was an early-20th-century circus; with sideshow stars and curious entertainments. We created a three-piece invitation; which included a kraft envelope; a fold-out poster with general event information; event preview insert; and an insert for the premium dinner portion of the evening; which had its own special tent. While the poster and envelope were printed digitally elsewhere; we chose to letterpress the dinner card insert because the tactile quality of letterpress printing and its history paired perfectly with our design language; historical typefaces; a strongman; and circus barker slang.","files":[{"url":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/gSjfKD4YRXuA6kHbUYu8","filename":"HoMA-Contempo-invite-001.jpg","mimetype":"image/jpeg","size":1190824,"key":"qYOMQTBJTEaXVX1edZGc_HoMA-Contempo-invite-001.jpg","isWriteable":true},{"url":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Nlgms23SE6NWeZpITDUw","filename":"HoMA-Contempo-invite-002.jpg","mimetype":"image/jpeg","size":1416363,"key":"FkYaRBM7SuGZBakMinHO_HoMA-Contempo-invite-002.jpg","isWriteable":true},{"url":"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/qGeAcGCxRUOXPX1fbmhA","filename":"HoMA-Contempo-invite-003.jpg","mimetype":"image/jpeg","size":1467718,"key":"mKvNB7rfRCa3z5e2JBKU_HoMA-Contempo-invite-003.jpg","isWriteable":true}]},{"id":"GM2HzDiKmvrJdHLSi","contact_name":"Celeste Chikamori","email":"celeste@walltowall.com","phone":"808-566-0880","agency_name":"Wall-to-Wall Studios","aiga_id":"","project_name":"Iolani School Rebrand Campaign","client_name":"Iolani School","url":"Edward Enterprises;

Hawaii.gov leverages text; SQL; JSON; RSS and ATOM data sources for content and Git for version control. Markdown; a markup language; and Liquid Templates combine the dynamic and static data sources. We employ Jenkins; an open source continuous integration tool written to re-generate the entire site with updated data feeds every hour or on demand by invoking Jekyll to stitch everything together into a static HTML5 website.
