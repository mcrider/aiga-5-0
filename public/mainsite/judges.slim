            p AIGA Honolulu makes every effort to choose judges who are qualified to make informed decisions about what constitutes design excellence. The panel is always made up of judges from states other than Hawaii to minimize the likelihood of bias.
            p 5-O judging takes place in a large, secure room in which all the entries are laid out on tables for the judges to examine. Web and motion entries are displayed live on laptops. The judges are free to determine their own process for coming to a consensus about which 50 entries are selected as winners and, of those, which are the Top 5. They will also select three student winners. No AIGA board members are allowed into the room while the judges are reviewing or deliberating. The process can take anywhere from 5-10 hours.
